Edinburgh Napier University - Software Engineering Methods SET08103
# Code of Conduct
This code of conduct document is to highlight the guidelines for which the team including Gabriel Saliev, Markus Meresma, Mab Leslie and Rory Gatens are working on for the coursework assignment for software engineering methods.
## Policy brief & purpose
Our student code of conduct outlines the expectations we hold regarding students behaviours towards one another through the duration of this module.
As a team we expect a respectful, positive environment where we can participate in sharing ideas and motivate one another. And we expect all students to follow our code of conduct. Students should avoid disputing with one another and any other form of disruption impacting the workflow.
## Scope
This policy applies to all group members regardless of their role in this coursework. This code of conduct is legible during the process of the courseworks completion, presentation and any meetings held in regards to it. This should be enforced by all team members and university staff involved.
## Policy elements
### What are the components of an Employee Code of Conduct Policy?
#### Respect in the workplace
All students should respect one another. The team won’t allow any kind of discriminatory behavior, harassment or victimization. Employees should conform with the universities standards in all aspects of their work, including their performance evaluation.
#### Professionalism
All students must show a high level of integrity and professionalism:
* **Work duties and authority**

All students should complete their individual tasks assigned during weekly meetings to meet code review deadlines. Students should not allow one or more team member(s) to pick up anyone else’s slack; this is a group effort. No one is inherently in charge of this team. We must collaborate as equals and each of us must be able to delegate based on each other's strengths. Alongside this team members are expected to help one another if they are able to.
* **Missconduct**

All students must agree that the software skills learned in this module must not be used in a harmful or malicious way in any form. Students must also report anyone else who is suspected of using this software in a harmful manner to the module/programme leader.
* **Conflict of interest**

We expect students to avoid any interests that may hinder their capability or willingness to input work to the project. However following any unforeseen personal circumstance changes, students should contact their module leader regarding any issues. The university also offers a wide range of support found on the wellbeing, support and inclusion tab on the Napier website.
* **Collaboration**

Students should be friendly and collaborative. They should try not to disrupt the workplace or present obstacles to their colleagues' work.
* **Communication**

All students must be open to communicate with their team members and module leaders.
## Disciplinary actions

Students should seek assistance from their module/programme leader if any issues arise in the duration of this coursework project. Not cooperating with team members during this project/not putting in the same effort as others could cause students to lose marks or even fail the module. Only module/programme leaders are responsible for decisions on any, if at all necessary, disciplinary actions. For more information on disciplinary actions, please see the disciplinary procedures section in the coursework specification on Github.
